However, it is also possible to specify a certain temperature (T) and humidity (Td) for the surface parcel. This option is very useful now, because it allows you to estimate the value of CAPE after some diurnal heating. At 00 UTC the surface mixing ratio (qv_surf) was about 12 g/kg. Assume that the surface moisture increases by about 10% due to daytime heating. Try out different values for the temperature. What CAPE values do you expect around noon? What would your weather prediction be for the Northern part of Switzerland at this time?"
