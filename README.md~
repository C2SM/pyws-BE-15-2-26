# Scientific Programming in Python for Atmospheric Sciences and Climatology

## Format

The lectures mostly consist of Ipython Notebooks. There is an "Intro"
slidedeck and one related to Exercise 3 in the folder "slides".

## Audience

Python novices who should have programming experience in other
languages. A number of exmples and problems are drawn from the field
of Atmospheric Dynamics and Climate Impact Research.

## Duration

An eight hour day. This is enough time to cover Exercises 1
through 4.

Exercise 5 is not really an exercise but rather a very explicit walk
through the solution of a real world problem that combines several
powerful packages. This Note
