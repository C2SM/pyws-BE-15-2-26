# Scientific Programming in Python for Atmospheric Sciences and Climatology

## Format

The lectures mostly consist of Ipython Notebooks. There is an "Intro"
slidedeck and one related to Exercise 3 in the folder "slides".

## Audience

Python novices who should have programming experience in other
languages. A number of exmples and problems are drawn from the field
of Atmospheric Dynamics and Climate Impact Research.

## Duration

An eight hour day. This is enough time to cover Exercises 1
through 4.

## Bonus Material

Exercise 5 is not really an exercise but rather a very explicit walk
through the solution of a real world problem that combines several
powerful packages. This Notebook uses `PIL`, `Cartopy`, `matplotlib`,
`CDO.py`, `requests`, `Pandas` to solve as GIS-like problem. This
Notebook could form the basis of a final exercise in an advanced
workshop that deals with the visualization of geocoded data.

Exercise 6 are some basic (and rather simple) Python coding
exercises. In previous workshops they got not so stellar marks in the
evaluation. They are left, so interested participants can use them on
their own.
